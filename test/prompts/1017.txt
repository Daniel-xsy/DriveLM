What object should the ego vehicle notice second when the ego vehicle is getting to the next possible location? What is the state of the object perceived by the ego vehicle as second and what action should the ego vehicle take? What object should the ego vehicle notice third? What is the state of the object perceived by the ego vehicle as third and what action should the ego vehicle take?
- Firstly notice that <c3,CAM_FRONT,1043.2,82.2>. The object is a traffic sign, so the ego vehicle should keep going ahead at the same speed. Secondly notice that <c1,CAM_BACK,1088.3,497.5>. The object is turning left, so the ego vehicle should keep going ahead at the same speed. Thirdly notice that <c2,CAM_BACK,864.2,468.3>. The object is going ahead, so the ego vehicle should keep going ahead at the same speed.

- Q2: Is <c1,CAM_BACK,1088.3,497.5> a traffic sign or a road barrier?
